This React-JS web application is built as an analytic tool for psychological outcomes. It includes a patient management dashboard, outcomes interpretation dashboard, report generation, and self-report measure distribution, scoring, and storage. In addition, it is fully equipped with user authentication, individual and team account management, permission control for admin accounts, and a built in email client. 

This application was designed with the goal of easy self-report outcomes collection and interpretation for clinicians in a psychiatric setting. Additional patient and team management is added to maximize ease of use. Psychological self-report outcomes are proven to be the strongest clinical indicator of patient mental health (Levinson & Kaplan, 2014), so their regular collection from individual patients is crucial. However, this process can be expensive, not only financially, but also in terms of time and resource allocation. This prototype is designed to minimize time spent on outcomes collection, processing, and interpretation without compromising their validity. A scalable, inexpensive, tech-based solution for this problem will allow hospitals with less-abundent resources to collect outcomes at the same volume and precision as major psychiatric hospitals accross the country. 

This prototype model is currently designed to distribute outcomes to patients once a week over a six-week program, while automatically processing their data, scoring their measures and visualizing it for easy interpretation. The measures currently collected are the Patient Health Questionnaire - 15 (Somatization), Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 (Depression), Generlaized Anxiety Disorder - 7 assesment, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Suicide Behviors Questionnaire Revised. 

**Ongoing Challenges:**
- Configuration:
  - The application's backend is node/express.js API designed to run using a Vercel serverless distribution. financial constraints have delayed deployment for a few more weeks. 

**Future Goals:**
- Add program, timepoint, and measure customization so taht every hospital can mold the application to their program specific needs.
- Add in more self-rpeort measures including the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, Disturbig Dreams and Nightmares Severity Index, PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, and several others.
